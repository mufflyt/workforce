# Workforce
Workforce data for Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons


I am working with Rui and Elena to look at visits with FPMRS physicians.  My role is bringing in the list of physicians who are FPMRS.  

## Urology FPMRS
I was able to find data on Urology board-certified FPMRS at the AUA patient-facing site and the "Is Your Doctor Board Certified?" with ABU:

* [Urology Care Foundation, The Official Foundation of the American Urological Association](https://www.urologyhealth.org/find-a-urologist) - This provides a list of providers and their subspecialty.  The year of certification is listed for their primary board cert in Urology.  
![ABU Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4m00ycj9ch73yfw/AUA_find.png?raw=1)

* [ABU List of Board-Certified Urologists with their FPMRS certification](https://www.abu.org/diplomatesearch) - I searched state-by-state to find the data.  In states with over 250 providers we then searched by city and state.

* [Wikipedia cities and states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population) - The five largest cities in each state were searched from this list.  

We changed the data from long to wide with one physician per row/observation and matched with the NPI number:
