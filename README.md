# Workforce
Workforce data for Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons


I am working with Rui and Elena to look at visits with FPMRS physicians.  My role is bringing in the list of physicians who are FPMRS.  

## ABMS Data
* [ABMS Certification Data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8bdf0z7eyd2yea7/abms-board-certification-report-2018-2019.pdf?raw=1).  The ABMS provides a publicly-accessible guide regarding certificates issued for all specialties and subspecialties including FPMRS.  They use information provided annually by ABOG.  Table 3B: New Subspecialty Certificates Issued by ABMS Member Boards 2009–2018.  Look for **both** OBGYN (top) and urology (bottom) numbers:

Table 3C: ABMS Board Certified Physicians by Member Board and State.  Look for **both** OBGYN and urology numbers:

## Urology FPMRS
I was able to find data on Urology board-certified FPMRS at the AUA patient-facing site and the "Is Your Doctor Board Certified?" with ABU:

* [Urology Care Foundation, The Official Foundation of the American Urological Association](https://www.urologyhealth.org/find-a-urologist) - This provides a list of providers and their subspecialty.  The year of certification is listed for their primary board cert in Urology.  
![ABU Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4m00ycj9ch73yfw/AUA_find.png?raw=1)

* [ABU List of Board-Certified Urologists with their FPMRS certification](https://www.abu.org/diplomatesearch) - I searched state-by-state to find the data.  In states with over 250 providers we then searched by city and state.

![ABU Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6kttw8bvmc5e7yg/ABU_Search.png?raw=1)

* [Wikipedia cities and states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population) - The five largest cities in each state were searched from this list.  

We changed the data from long to wide with one physician per row/observation and matched with the NPI number:

```

Lastly we confirmed FPMRS status by NPI taxonomy code.  

## OBGYN FPMRS
* [NPI List of Board-Certified with FPMRS taxonomy code](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/) - I searched for the text string `female pelvic medicine` in the USA for individuals and not offices/hospitals.  
![NPPES Search Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j6p3dtb83tw12aa/NPPES_search.png?raw=1)
![NPPES Search Results Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ff6u1464yppm8fh/NPPES_search_results.png?raw=1)
We were able to find FPMRS board certification from the NPI database.  

* [NPPES NPI Registry Downloadable file](https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html) - I searched for the text string `female pelvic medicine` in the USA for individuals and not offices/hospitals.  This NPI data is available as a downloaded file that is HUGE so it breaks a one core system like R.  This is the raw output of the NPI data file from NPPES.  I outputed the data from JMP as a txt file where I filtered.
